# GUI-Bank-Application
C# and mySQL GUI Bank Application

This C# and mySql Bank Application will allow for an Admin to register new customers to the database and check active users. Once a customer has been registered, they will be able to check their balance, deposit money, withdraw money, send money to another account and display a bank transaction statement.

In order to use this application create a database called 'bank' within a localhost database e.g XAMMP/PhpMyadmin and the application will be ready for use.
